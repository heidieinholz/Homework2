            Hello! I'm Heidi Einholz, pastry chef turned programmer. I am 31 years old and live with my fiance and daughter in Arvada, Colorado. I grew up in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, where I grew to disdain the "Real Housewife" culture that surrounded me. I attended college in Madison, NJ at Drew University, where I majored in German and minored in writing. I briefly pursued a career in Social Media Marketing in central New Jersey and Philadelphia before deciding to pursue my passion of baking.  
            <br><br>
            I moved to Boulder, CO in 2012 to attend Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts. After graduating I began a 7-year career as a pastry chef, working in multiple fine-dining restaurants in the Denver/Boulder area, as well as in the best bakery in Denver, and finally at the Four Seasons Hotel. During my career as a pastry chef I met my future husband, we bought a house in Arvada together, and welcomed our first child in January 2019.  
            <br><br>
            Learning to code is the beginning of my next chapter in life!</p>
